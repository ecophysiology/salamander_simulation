# salamander_simulation
The following script generates estimates of activity, energy balance, and extinction throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains for high elevation lungless salamanders. Each section contains a heading that describes the various components of the script, from libraries to simulations. The script was built using Python (version 2.7). The script generates ASCII files and a dataframe of summary statistics. Be sure to enter the correct path for your temperature data as well as the output paths for the results. The paths that require the users attention have been labelled as your_path_here.
